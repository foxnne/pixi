## Contributing

Hello and thank you so much for considering contributing to Pixi!

By suggestion, this document will hopefully serve as a good starting point for understanding Pixi's internals and where things are. However, if you ever have any questions or would like
to have a conversation about Pixi, please reach out to me on discord or add an issue. I'm "foxnne" on discord as well.

### Overview

Pixi is built using several game development libraries by others in the Zig community, as well as a C library for handling zipped files. The dependencies are as follows: 
  - **mach-core**: Handles windowing and input, and uses the new zig package manager. This library and dependencies will be downloaded to the cache on build.
  - **nfd_zig**: Native file dialogs wrapper, copied into the src/deps folder.
  - **zgui**: Wrapper for Dear Imgui, which is copied into the src/deps/zig-gamedev folder.
  - **zmath**: Math library, primarily using this for vector math and matrices. As above, this is copied into the src/deps/zig-gamedev folder.
  - **zstbi**: Wrapper for stbi provided by zig-gamedev. This handles loading and resizing images. As above, this is copied into the src/deps/zig-gamedev folder.
  - **zip**: Wrapper for the zip library, copied into the src/deps folder.

Outside of the `src` folder, we have `assets` which contain all assets that we would like to be copied over next to the executable and used by Pixi at runtime.

`pixi.zig` holds all the main loop information and init, update, and deinit functions. Mach-core handles the main entry point and calls these functions for us. Mach-core is multi-threaded in the sense that there are two update loops, one which is run on the main thread, and one that runs in a separate thread. For more information about mach-core please see [the mach-core website](https://machengine.org/core/).

Please note that we need to handle native file dialogs from the main thread, which is currently how Pixi handles it. I tried to set this up as a request/response.

Inside of the `src` folder we have several subfolders. I tried to organize the project based on a few categories as follows:

Outside of these subfolders, please note that `assets.zig` is generated so don't edit this file.

- **algorithms**: This folder holds any generalized algorithms for use in pixel art operations. As of writing this, it only currently contains the brezenham algorithm used
  by the stroke/pencil tool. This algorithm handles quick mouse movements when drawing and prevents broken lines, as each frame a line is drawn from the previous frame.

- **deps**: This folder holds the previously outlined dependencies, except for those that are using the new zig package manager.
- **editor**: This folder holds individual files generally with simple *draw()* functions that mimic the layout of the editor itself. I tried to use subfolders and similar to
  set the project up in a way that was easy to understand from looking at the editor itself.
     -  i.e. `editor/artboard/canvas.zig` is the file responsible for the canvas within the main artboard, while `editor/artboard/flipbook/canvas.zig` is the canvas within the flipbook.
     -  Note that `editor.zig` contains a bit more than just drawing of the editor panels, and contains many of the main *editor* related functions, like loading and opening files, setting the project folder,
        saving files, and importing png files.

- **gfx**: Pixi is set up similar to a game, with the flipbook and main artboard having a camera. Each file actually has its own Camera, which allows u  
  to have individual views per file, and not a shared camera between all files. That means you can be working on two files and not have your camera move around as you switch.
    - Other things in gfx are general things related to textures, atlases, quads, etc. Some of this is unused currently and can be removed.

- **input**: Input holds hotkeys and mouse information. 
  - `Hotkeys.zig` is my attempt at trying to set up configurable hotkeys in the future.

- **math**: General math functions I've written or picked up over time. 
- **shaders**: Currently doesn't get used, but in the future if we support using the GPU for some operations, the wgsl files would live here.
- **storage**: This is where History, and the containers used to store information are. internal and external contain the structs used to describe a pixi file internally, with additional information for the program to use, or externally, which should be easily exported as JSON.
- **tools**: A few helpful things such as font-awesome mapping, an example of the build step to process assets, and the Packer struct, which is responsible for packing all sprites to an atlas.
