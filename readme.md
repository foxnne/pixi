    - Possibly .pyxel and .asesprite import
    - Export to .zig to directly use in Zig frameworks
    - .gif support
- [x] Palettes
- Tiles 
- Possibly much more

## Compilation

- Zig version required is latest mach nominated version, find [here.]https://machengine.org/docs/nominated-zig/#2024110-mach(https://machengine.org/docs/nominated-zig/#2024110-mach)
