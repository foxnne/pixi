## Features planned for 0.1
- [x] Typical pixel art operations. (draw, erase, color select)
- [x] Create animations and preview easily, edit directly on the preview.
- [x] View previous and next frames of the animation.
- [x] Set sprite origins for drawing sprites easily in game frameworks.
- [x] Import and slice existing .png spritesheets.
- [x] Intuitive and customizeable user interface.
- [x] Sprite packing

## User Interface
- The user interface is driven by [Dear Imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) which should be familiar to many.
- The general layout takes many ideas from VSCode, as well as general project setup using folders.

## Planned Features

- Export/import options.
    - Possibly .pyxel and .asesprite import
    - Export to .zig to directly use in Zig frameworks
    - .gif support
- [x] Palettes
- Tiles 
- Possibly much more

## Compilation
- [Linux] Ensure `gtk+3-devel` or similar is installed (for native file dialogs).
- Download the latest Zig master from [here](https://ziglang.org/download/) and add to PATH.
- Clone pixi.
- Build.
    - ```git clone https://github.com/foxnne/pixi.git```
    - ```cd pixi```
    - ```zig build run```
